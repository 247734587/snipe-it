# Translations!

If you're not a coder but want to give back to the project and you're fluent in other languages, consider helping out with the translations. We use the [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com) localization platform to manage translations, and it makes it super-simple for you to add translations to the project without messing with code. Check out [the Snipe-IT CrowdIn translation project here](https://crowdin.com/project/snipe-it/).

We currently have English, Spanish, German, Korean and Brazilian Portuguese completed, and are looking for more!

If you'd like to translate Snipe-IT into a language that we don't currently offer, simply let us know via the CrowdIn platform and we'll get tha set up for you.
