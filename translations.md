# Translations!

If you're not a coder but want to give back to the project and you're fluent in other languages, consider helping out with the translations. We use [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com) to manage translations, and it makes it super-simple for you to add translations to the project without messing with code. Check out [the Snipe-IT CrowdIn translation project here](https://crowdin.com/project/snipe-it/).

We currently have English and Spanish completed, and are looking for lots more!
