# User Management

Snipe-IT comes with ability to manage users within the system.

### User Throttling / Unsuspending Users

If a user locks themselves out by attempting and failing to login too many times (default is 5 failed attempts), they will be locked out of the system for 15 minutes. If you need to unlock them before the 15 minutes is up, you can manually unsuspend them by going to the People section, searching for their name, and then clicking the unsuspend icon.
