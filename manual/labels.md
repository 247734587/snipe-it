# Generating Asset Labels

Generating labels for your assets is very simple in Snipe-IT. Simple go to any of the asset listing views (Ready to Deploy, Deployed, etc) and use the checkboxes in the leftmost column to select the assets you'd like to generate labels for. Once you've finished your selection, scroll down to the bottom of the asset listing table, and select "Generate Labels" from the dropdown list.

This will generate labels that should fit Avery 5160 in portrait mode, or a similarly-sized two-across, nine-down (in portrait mode) label sheet. There is enough padding around the labels to provide some flexibility with your choice of label sheets.
