<p><strong>Before opening an issue to report a bug or request help, make sure you've checked the <a href="http://docs.snipeitapp.com/common-issues.html">Common Issues</a> and <a href="http://docs.snipeitapp.com/getting-help.html">Getting Help</a> pages.</strong></p>
<h2 id="developing-on-snipe-it">Developing on Snipe-IT</h2>
<p>Please submit all pull requests to the <a href="http://github.com/snipe/snipe-it">snipe/snipe-it</a> repository in the <code>develop</code> branch!</p>
<p><strong>As you're working on bug-fixes or features, please break them out into their own feature branches and open the pull request against your feature branch</strong>. It makes it <em>much</em> easier to decipher down the road, as you open multiple pull requests over time, and makes it much easier for me to approve pull requests quickly.</p>
<p>If you don't have a feature in mind, but would like to contribute back to the project, check out the <a href="https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/issues?state=open">open issues</a> and see if there are any you can tackle.</p>
<p>We use Waffle.io to help better communicate our roadmap with users. Our <a href="http://waffle.io/snipe/snipe-it">project page there</a> will show you the backlog, what's ready to be worked on, what's in progress, and what's completed.</p>
<p><a href="http://waffle.io/snipe/snipe-it"><img src="https://badge.waffle.io/snipe/snipe-it.png?label=ready&amp;title=Ready" alt="Stories in Ready" /></a></p>
<p>The labels we use in GitHub Issues and Waffle.io indicate whether we've confirmed an issue as a bug, whether we're considering the issue as a potential feature, and whether it's ready for someone to work on it. We also provide labels such as &quot;n00b&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; for the experience level we think it requires for contributors who want to help.</p>

<h2 id="translations">Translations!</h2>
<p>If you're not a coder but want to give back to the project and you're fluent in other languages, that's okay too. We use <a href="https://crowdin.com">CrowdIn</a> to manage translations, and it makes it super-simple for you to add translations (or validate proposed translations) to the project without messing with code. <strong>Check out <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/snipe-it/">the Snipe-IT CrowdIn translation project here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
