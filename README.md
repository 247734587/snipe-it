# Snipe-IT Installation Guide & User's Manual

Snipe-IT is a Free Open Source (FOSS) project for asset management in IT Operations. Knowing who has which laptop, when it was purchased in order to depreciate it correctly, handling software licenses, etc.

It is built on [Laravel 4.1](http://laravel.com) and uses the [Sentry 2](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry) package.

This project is being actively developed (at what seems like breakneck speed sometimes!) We're still in alpha release, so this is NOT recommended for production use yet, as many more things will likely change before v1.0-stable is ready - but we're [releasing quite frequently](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/releases). ([Check out the live demo here](http://snipeitapp.com/demo.php).)

__This is web-based software__. This means there there is no executable file (aka no .exe files), and it must be run on a web server and accessed through a web browser. It runs on any Mac OSX, flavor of Linux, as well as Windows.
