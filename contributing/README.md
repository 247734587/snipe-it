# Contribution Guidelines

Please submit all issues and pull requests to the [snipe/snipe-it](http://github.com/snipe/snipe-it) repository in the `develop` branch!

**As you're working on bug-fixes or features, please break them out into their own feature branches and open the pull request against your feature branch**. It makes it _much_ easier to decipher down the road, as you open multiple pull requests over time, and makes it much easier for me to approve pull requests quickly.

If you don't have a feature in mind, but would like to contribute back to the project, check out the [open issues](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/issues?state=open) and see if there are any you can tackle.

## Translations!

If you're not a coder but want to give back to the project and you're fluent in other languages, that's okay too. We use [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com) to manage translations, and it makes it super-simple for you to add translations (or validate proposed translations) to the project without messing with code. __Check out [the Snipe-IT CrowdIn translation project here](https://crowdin.com/project/snipe-it/)__.

Thanks!
